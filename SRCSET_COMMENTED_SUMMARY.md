## 🔍 **What Was Done:**

All srcset attributes with `@2x` images were wrapped in Blade comments like this:

**Before:**
```blade
<img src="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo.png') }}" 
     srcset="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo@2x.png') }} 2x" 
     alt="United Travels">
```

**After:**
```blade
<img src="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo.png') }}" 
     {{-- srcset="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo@2x.png') }} 2x" --}} 
     alt="United Travels">
```

---

## ✅ **Result:**

- Images will still display perfectly using the regular versions
- No broken image links
- Slightly faster page loads (smaller images)
- Easy to uncomment when @2x images become available

---

## 🎯 **When You Create @2x Images:**

Simply remove the comment tags `{{--` and `--}}` to activate them:

**Example:**
```blade
<!-- Uncomment this when you have the @2x image -->
<img src="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo.png') }}" 
     srcset="{{ asset('assets/img/logos/logo@2x.png') }} 2x" 
     alt="United Travels">
```

---

## 📝 **Summary:**

- **Total files updated:** 4 files
- **Total srcset commented:** 8 occurrences
- **Total srcset kept active:** 3 occurrences (in home.blade.php)
- **View cache:** Cleared ✅

---

## 🚀 **Your website is ready!**

All pages will work perfectly with the current images. The commented-out srcset won't cause any errors or broken images.

When you're ready to create @2x images, you can uncomment them one by one!
