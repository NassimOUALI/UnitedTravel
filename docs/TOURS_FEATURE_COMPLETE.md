#### Routes
```php
Route::resource('tours', \App\Http\Controllers\Admin\TourController::class);
```
This creates all 7 RESTful routes:
- `GET /admin/tours` - index
- `GET /admin/tours/create` - create form  
- `POST /admin/tours` - store new
- `GET /admin/tours/{tour}` - show

### 2. Public Browsing ✅
*(Already implemented in previous session)*

  - `index()` - List all tours with filters
  - `show()` - Single tour details with destinations

- **`resources/views/tours/index.blade.php`**
  - Grid layout of tour cards
  - Shows: image, title, duration, price, discount
  - Search and filtering
  - Pagination

  - Detailed tour page
  - Full description and itinerary
  - Price display with discount calculation
  - Destinations covered
  - Booking CTA buttons

### 3. Image Upload Support ✅

#### Storage Configuration
- **Storage Link**: `php artisan storage:link` (already created)
  - Public access to uploaded images via `public/storage`
  - Images stored in `storage/app/public/tours/`

#### Image Handling Features
- **Upload on Create**: New tours can have images
- **Upload on Update**: Replace existing images
- **Automatic Deletion**: Old images are deleted when replaced or tour is deleted
- **Validation**:
  - Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, JPG, WebP
  - Maximum size: 2MB
  - Client-side preview before upload

#### Image Display

- Public pages: Responsive images with proper alt text

### 4. Advanced Features ✅

#### Price Management
- **Optional Pricing**: Tours can have undefined prices (for custom quotes)
- **Price Toggle**: `is_price_defined` checkbox to indicate if price is final
- **Display Logic**:
  - If `is_price_defined = true` and `price` set: Show "$XXX.XX"
  - Otherwise: Show "Price TBD" or "Contact for pricing"
- **Validation**: Price must be numeric, non-negative, and within reasonable bounds

#### Discount System
- **Optional Discount**: Tours can have an associated discount
- **Foreign Key**: `discount_id` links to `discounts` table
- **Admin Interface**: Dropdown shows all available discounts
- **Display**: Discount percentage badge shown in list and details
- **Validation**: Ensures discount exists before associating

#### Destination Association (Many-to-Many)
- **Multiple Destinations**: Tours can cover multiple destinations
- **Pivot Table**: `tour_destination` handles the relationship
- **Admin Interface**: Multi-select dropdown (hold Ctrl/Cmd for multiple)
- **Sync Logic**: Properly syncs selected destinations on create/update
- **Display**: Shows count in admin list, full list in details

### 5. Integration with Existing System ✅

#### Admin Dashboard Links
The admin dashboard (`resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`) includes:
- Quick action button: "Add Tour"
- Recent tours list with edit/delete
- Tour stats with price and discount display
- "View All" link to tours index

#### Navigation
- Admin panel accessible via `/admin/dashboard`
- Tours management via `/admin/tours`
- Protected by `auth` and `admin` middleware

#### Database Integration
- Uses existing `tours` table from migrations
- Relationships:
  - `belongsToMany(Destination)` via `tour_destination` pivot
  - `belongsTo(Discount)` for discount association
- Proper eager loading for performance (`with(['destinations', 'discount'])`)

## Features Breakdown

### Validation Rules
```php
'title' => 'required|string|max:150'
'description' => 'required|string'
'duration' => 'required|string|max:50'

## Comparison: Tours vs Destinations

| Feature | Destinations | Tours |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Image Upload | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Simple Fields | 3 (name, location, description) | 4 (title, description, duration, price) |
| Relationships | tours (many-to-many) | destinations (many-to-many), discount (belongs-to) |
| Price Management | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (with TBD option) |
| Discount Support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Boolean Flags | ❌ No | ✅ is_price_defined |
| Multi-select in Form | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (destinations) |
| Complexity | Simple | More Complex |

## Next Steps

Now that Tours are complete, you can:
1. **Implement Announcements CRUD** (simpler, similar to destinations)
2. **Implement Discounts CRUD** (date validation, percentage rules)
3. **Add booking functionality** (create bookings table and flow)
4. **Enhance tour details** (add itinerary builder, inclusions/exclusions)
5. **Add reviews system** (ratings and comments for tours)
6. **Implement tour calendar** (availability dates)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Images Not Displaying
1. Ensure storage link exists: `php artisan storage:link`
2. Check file permissions on `storage/` directory
3. Verify `APP_URL` in `.env` is correct
4. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`

### Multi-select Not Working
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
2. Try holding Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (Mac)
3. Consider using a better UI library (e.g., Select2) for enhanced UX

### Destinations Not Syncing
1. Check pivot table `tour_destination` exists
2. Verify relationship methods in `Tour` and `Destination` models
3. Ensure correct pivot table name specified

### Discount Not Showing
1. Verify discount exists in database
2. Check discount_id is properly saved
3. Ensure eager loading: `with('discount')`
