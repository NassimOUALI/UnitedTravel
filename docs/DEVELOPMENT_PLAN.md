# United Travels - Complete Development Plan

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working (Solid Foundation)
1. **Database Layer** - Complete with 8 tables and relationships
2. **Authentication** - Login, registration, role-based access control
3. **Core Pages** - Home, login, register, admin dashboard
4. **Layout System** - Reusable components (header, footer, hero, modals)
5. **Asset Integration** - CSS/JS properly linked with asset() helper
6. **Demo Data Seeder** - Ready to populate database with sample content

### ⚠️ Critical Gaps Identified
1. **No Admin CRUD** - Can't create/edit destinations, tours, etc.
2. **No Public Pages** - Destinations and tours pages are placeholders
3. **No Image Upload** - File upload system not implemented
4. **No Validation Requests** - Using inline validation only
5. **No Error Pages** - 404, 403, 500 pages missing
6. **No Flash Messages** - Success/error feedback not displayed
7. **No Pagination** - Will fail with large datasets
8. **No Search/Filter** - Can't find specific tours or destinations
9. **Password Reset** - UI exists but backend missing

### 🎯 Business-Critical Features Missing
- Admin can't manage content (biggest blocker)
- Users can't browse tours properly
- No booking system
- No contact form functionality
- No email notifications
