## 🚀 **Usage:**

### **Check if user is root (in controller):**
```php
if (auth()->user()->isRoot()) {
    // Only root can do this
}
```

### **Check if user is root (in blade):**
```blade
@if(auth()->user()->isRoot())
    <!-- Only show to root admin -->
@endif
```

### **Check if user is admin:**
```php
if (auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
    // User has admin role
}
```

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

1. **is_root cannot be changed via form** - Protected in controller
2. **Root user cannot be deleted** - Hard-coded protection
3. **Only one root user should exist** - Manually managed
4. **Root status is separate from roles** - Root can have any role
5. **Root is the highest privilege** - Supersedes all role permissions

---

## 🔧 **Manual Root Assignment:**

If you need to make another user root manually:

### **Via Tinker:**
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
```php
$user = App\Models\User::find(1);
$user->is_root = true;
$user->save();
```

### **Via Database:**
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_root = 1 WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```
