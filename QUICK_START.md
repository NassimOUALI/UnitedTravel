## ⚠️ What Doesn't Work Yet

These are **not implemented**:
- ❌ Creating/editing destinations (admin)
- ❌ Creating/editing tours (admin)
- ❌ Creating/editing announcements (admin)
- ❌ Creating/editing discounts (admin)
- ❌ Booking tours
- ❌ Wishlist

## 🔄 Reset Database

If you mess up the data:

```bash
# Fresh start with all demo data
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will:
1. Drop all tables
2. Recreate them
3. Seed with demo data

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Images not showing
**Fix**: The demo data uses placeholder paths. For now, images won't show (this is normal).

### Issue: 404 on routes
**Fix**: Make sure server is running:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Issue: Can't access admin panel
**Fix**: Make sure you're logged in as admin:
- Email: `admin@unitedtravels.com`
- Password: `password`

### Issue: Database errors
**Fix**: Re-run migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
