---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Fixed Announcements Visibility Issue**
**Problem**: The visibility checkbox wasn't working when trying to hide announcements.

**Root Cause**: Unchecked checkboxes don't send values in HTML forms, causing validation to fail.

**Solution**:
- Updated `StoreAnnouncementRequest` and `UpdateAnnouncementRequest`
- Changed `visible` validation from `required` to `nullable`
- Added `prepareForValidation()` method to handle checkbox state
```php
protected function prepareForValidation()
{
    $this->merge([
        'visible' => $this->has('visible') ? 1 : 0,
    ]);
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Requests/Admin/StoreAnnouncementRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/Admin/UpdateAnnouncementRequest.php`

---

### 2. **Action Buttons Standardization**
**Improvements**:
- ✅ Added proper icons for all actions:
  - 👁️ `hicon-view` for View buttons
  - ✏️ `hicon-edit` for Edit buttons
  - 🗑️ `hicon-trash` for Delete buttons
- ✅ Implemented proper button group rounding:
  - First button: `rounded-start`
  - Middle buttons: no rounding classes
  - Last button: `rounded-end`
- ✅ Converted forms to hidden forms with JavaScript onclick for better UX
- ✅ Added tooltips to all action buttons
- ✅ Consistent color scheme:
  - Info (blue) for View
  - Primary (blue) for Edit
  - Danger (red) for Delete

**Button Group Structure**:
```blade
<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm" role="group">
    <a href="..." class="btn btn-outline-info rounded-start" title="View" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">
        <i class="hicon hicon-view"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="..." class="btn btn-outline-primary" title="Edit" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">
        <i class="hicon hicon-edit"></i>
    </a>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger rounded-end" title="Delete" data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
            onclick="if(confirm('...')) { document.getElementById('delete-form-X').submit(); }">
        <i class="hicon hicon-trash"></i>
    </button>
</div>
<form id="delete-form-X" action="..." method="POST" class="d-none">
    @csrf
    @method('DELETE')
</form>
```
